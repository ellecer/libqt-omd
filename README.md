# libqt-omd

'libqt-omd' is a software library to control Olympus OM-D and Pen digital cameras over wifi.

Take [a look at the wiki](https://dev.0l.de/wiki/projects/omd/) for more information and protocol reverse engineering.

The library is based on Qt4 / Qt5 and implements two classes:

  1. *Camera* to control the camera and release the shutter.
  2. *LiveView* to stream a video of the viewfinder.

## Compatible Cameras

  - Olympus OM-D E-M5
  - Olympus OM-D E-M10
  - and most of the cameras which are compatible with [Olympus Image Share](http://app.olympus-imaging.com/oishare/).
